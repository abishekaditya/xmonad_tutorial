This is the Xmonad Tutorial for Beginning Beginners
===================================================================
If you are wanting to get started with using Xmonad, but are new to ubuntu or unix-like systems and/or new to setting up window manager environments yourself, this is the tutorial for you. It will not go into great depth for the sake of simplicity, but I will cite some other sources where you can find the more complicated explanations.
